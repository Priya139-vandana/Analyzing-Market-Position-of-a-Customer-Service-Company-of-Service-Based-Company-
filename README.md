# Report Objective
The company is requesting to build out a monthly report that captures Organization’s Response Times SLA’s. This is a report that will be utilized by senior management within 
their Service Division which oversees customer service as well as field service technicians. The senior management team would like to review the results of their response times on an ongoing basis 
in an effort to ensure they are meeting their performance goals, and if they are not, then to identify where there are issues. The Organization has set itself apart from competitors 
by being the only ones in the entire country that offer a 90-minute response time (SLA) and by providing a guarantee as well. For every minute that the Organization arrives to a 
Service Call after the 90-minute response time (SLA), they will credit back that customer 1% of that Equipment’s monthly invoice amount.
